# Hotel-app

This is a full-stack project built using Next.js.

🔥 **Key Features:**  
✅ Email-based login system — secure and simple for users.  
✅ Book appointments only after logging in — prevents spam and anonymous bookings.  
✅ Choose your doctor — users can select the doctor they want to visit.  
✅ Separate navigation bars for users and admins — keeps the experience clean and focused.  
✅ Admin dashboard — admins can manage:  
 • Doctor list  
 • Patient list  
 • View and manage appointment bookings  
✅ Admin operations — easily add, delete, and update doctors and patients.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Some features may not work in the deployed version because I don’t have a paid **Clerk** plan. But everything works 100% on localhost.
